.NET demo
=============

# Overview

The intention of this repository is to show developers how to abstract out connection logic and starting an application into a class for reuse

## Features
The demo consists of two applications one being a winforms application which would launch an openfin web application.  The two applications can communicate with each other via the interapplication bus.  When modifying the values in the winforms application this should also change what is displayed in the openfin web application
